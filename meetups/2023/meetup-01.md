## The talks for the evening will be:

### Welcome - Let's build a new community together
[Tue Henriksen][th] from [r2p] is the founder of Rust Aarhus with a background in the embedded world. He started using Rust when he joined r2p in late 2019.

He will like to welcome you all and talk about how we can create an awesome community together.

### Why learn Rust if I know a memory-safe language?
[Philip Kristoffersen][pk] is a senior software consultant (Full-stack & Architect) at [BRØLSTÆRK] and works with everything from 3D Visualization to Microservices.

This evening he'll compare Rust, C# and TypeScript features and their pros & cons, followed by a Q&A.

### Breaking the limits of Rust: Exploring Static Reflection for Powerful Code Generation
[Wojciech Polak][wp] is a senior full-stack engineer at [Impero] and works with the backend, tools, and libraries, all written in Rust.
He will show some of his work on generating schema and bindings for TypeScript from the Rust codebase, existing alternatives, drawbacks, and advantages, as well as how to use static reflection to overcome the limits.

Static reflection - (not existing) mechanism of Rust that allows accessing the meta-data about types and traits during the runtime, for example, what fields the structure has, what the names are, and what the implementations of the given trait are.

His presentation targets an intermediate audience, but he will explain everything if needed. A Q&A will follow the talk.
