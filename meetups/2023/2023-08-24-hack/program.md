# Rust Aarhus and Trifork invite beginners and experienced to this "Hack and Learn" event.

The experienced will split into different clusters and work on whatever they like. Here are some ideas, but it is totally up to you if you want to set up a cluster or if you want to join a cluster. Clusters can come and go throughout the evening.

    - Get feedback for your coming new crate, application, or blog post.
    - Get help understanding a Rust concept or a new crate.
    - Contribute to an open-source project.
    - Get your code reviewed.
    - Get help debugging your application.
    - Have fun on codewars or exercism.

The beginners will learn some Rust concepts by hacking through different exercises. There will be no lectures, but you will be given information to get you through the exercises and hopefully inspire you to dig deeper into the Rust language. All beginners must be familiar with at least one other programming language.

The program for the evening will be:

    18:00: Welcome by Tue Henriksen
    18:30: Split out into clusters
    19:00: Light dinner sponsored by Trifork
    19:45: Continue working in clusters
    20:30: Let’s hear what you have been working on
    20:50: Niels’ book lottery
    21:00: Thank you for a hopefully wonderful and rewarding evening. Feedback for the meetup will be appreciated.

Let’s continue the talk over a beer at Hantwerk, just around the corner.
