## Playing Duke Nukem 3D via Rust
[INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPEAKERS]

The  Duke Nukem 3D launcher project is about orchestrating the setup and launch of the Duke Nukem 3D game among different peers on different platforms. This includes the load of custom game files and parsing of game statistics. All of this is wrapped up into a GUI application to make the experience as easy for the user as possible.

During this talk we will cover topics

- Handling OS-specific behaviour
- Client - server communication using [tokio_util::codec](https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/index.html)::[codec](https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/codec/index.html#)
- Server architecture for message handling
- Parsing log files using [peg](https://docs.rs/peg/latest/peg/#) parser generator

[ADD DESCRIPTION OF THE TALK HERE]

## An innocent story of contributing to a Rust project
[Ole Friis Østergaard][ofo] works at GitHub, mainly does Ruby, but also sometimes does Rust in his spare time.

We'll talk about a time when [Ole][ofo] contributed functionality to an existing Rust crate. The journey took an interesting turn at some point, and he learned things he never thought he would learn. Now you will learn it too, and you will never un-learn it.

## Location
This meetup will be at Concordium, Åboulevarden 31, 1st floor. Please feel free to use the comments on this meetup event to organize transportation if needed.

## Food
