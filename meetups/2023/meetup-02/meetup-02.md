## When lifetimes give you lemons - an introduction to Rust lifetimes
[Philip Kristoffersen][pk] is a senior software consultant (Full-stack & Architect) at [BRØLSTÆRK] and works with everything from 3D Visualization to Microservices.

In this talk we will first get everyone up to speed on what lifetimes are and why they are needed in Rust.
Then we will look at how to use lifetimes, why they are cool and how to avoid common pitfalls.

## Solving Sudokus with Rust Iterators
[Niels Kristian Skovmand][ns] is a Software Engineer at CrowdStrike, working with frontend web development on [Falcon LogScale][logscale]. He has been a Rust enthusiast ever since doing the Rustlings course 2 years ago 🦀

In the talk we will cover how to implement a sudoku solving iterator in Rust. We will cover the backtracking technique, how to build custom iterators, the benefits of laziness and the benefits for the consumer of the iterator.

## Ansible in Rust
[Mikkel Dueholm][mdue] is a system administrator at [NOVAX A/S][novax] and daily works with people and servers in the healthcare space. A self-taught enthusiast representing the intermediate level.

This talk will cover implementing Ansible in Rust, with a focus on design and the challenges of switching from Python. It will provide insights into the rationale behind using Rust for automation tool development.

## Lightning Talks
Lighting talks for the evening:
 - Ole Friis Østergaard - Oles first open source contribution
 - Tue Henriksen - cargo deny
