## Advent of code
[Niels Kristian Skovmand][ns] is a Software Engineer at CrowdStrike, working with frontend web development on [Falcon LogScale][logscale]. He has been a Rust enthusiast ever since doing the Rustlings course 2 years ago.

[ADD DESCRIPTION OF THE TALK HERE]

## Shared mutable state in Rust
[Alice Ryhl][alice] is one of the core maintainers for Tokio. She is also a software engineer at Google, where she works on introducing Rust to the Linux kernel.

Rust's safety guarantees are based on the principle that you can have mutation or sharing, but not both. In this talk, you will see how to get both at the same time. There will be a special focus on how this is done in async code using Tokio, but we will also see how it is done in non-async code.


## Location
This meetup will be at Danske Commodities, Jægergårdsgade 118 in Aarhus.

## Food
If you have special needs regarding food (allergies, vegan, etc.), please forward your request directly to rustaarhus@gmail.com.
