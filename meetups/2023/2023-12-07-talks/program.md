## Advent of code
[Niels Kristian Skovmand][ns] is a Software Engineer at CrowdStrike, working with frontend web development on [Falcon LogScale][logscale]. He has been a Rust enthusiast ever since doing the Rustlings course 2 years ago.

Getting started with Advent of Code 2023 in Rust ðŸŽ„

We will live code the solution to one of the first [AoC2023][aoc2023] days in Rust. We will read the puzzle input from stdin, parse the input, and solve two puzzles. We will also write nice tests, and if time, add a GitHub Action to ensure Santa's software runs as intended going forward.

The talk is a beginner level talk in Rust.

## Shared mutable state in Rust
[Alice Ryhl][alice] is one of the core maintainers for Tokio. She is also a software engineer at Google, where she works on introducing Rust to the Linux kernel.

Rust's safety guarantees are based on the principle that you can have mutation or sharing, but not both. In this talk, you will see how to get both at the same time. There will be a special focus on how this is done in async code using Tokio, but we will also see how it is done in non-async code.


## Location
This meetup will be at Danske Commodities, JÃ¦gergÃ¥rdsgade 118 in Aarhus.
