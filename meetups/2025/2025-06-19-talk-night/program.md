## Gaussian Splatting in Rust

By [José Díaz][jd]

A technical overview of the current tools available in Rust for creating 3D models using Gaussian Splatting. The talk will explore the capabilities of these tools through practical examples and insights.

José is an Engineer with a passion for AI research in environmental applications. With experience in Full Stack and Machine Learning Engineering, he focuses on building new tools that can help protect biodiversity and nature across Chile and the world.


## Building a service in Rust

By [Kasper J. Hermansen][kjh]

Rust can be used for many things, we've mostly seen it be used for hardcore system level programming, games, operatings systems, crypto, what have you. I aim to show you a different route, take it down a notch if you will.

I will in this talk show you during a buildalong, how to build a web service that many companies would build all their business logic in and ship real features, in a manner that won't scare away you, or your colleagues.

Kasper is a software engineer that has worked on a wide variety of applications, whether they be mainframe assembler, building feature services, tooling, etc. He is currently building a Data Platform, parts of it of course in Rust.


## Location
This meetup will be at Trifork, Fiskerivej 2h, 8000 Aarhus. Please feel free to use the event chat on meetup to organize transportation if needed.
