## Await, there's more!

By Jonas Agger Jørgensen

During this beginner level talk, we'll walk through the idea of async/await, and it's implementation. We'll discover some of the paradigms used through a simple implementation of an Async Executor. We'll then also talk through of the pro's and con's of different executor patterns, and how you can avoid some of the common pitfalls.
