[INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPEAKER]

## Building a service in Rust

> FYI, feel free to take over this spot, I've time later during the spring/summer as well

By Kasper J. Hermansen

### Description

Rust can be used for many things, we've mostly seen it be used for hardcore system level programming, games, operatings systems, crypto, what have you. I aim to show you a different route, take it down a notch if you will.

I will in this talk show you during a buildalong, how to build a web service that many companies would build all their business logic in and ship real features, in a manner that won't scare away you, or your colleagues.

### Speaker

Kasper is a software engineer that has worked on a wide variety of applications, whether they be mainframe assembler, building feature services, tooling, etc. He is currently building a Data Platform, parts of it of course in Rust (:crab)

## Location
This meetup will be at Margrethepladsen 4, 3, 8000 Aarhus (bottom floor of Scandinavian Center).


## Food
We will try to have a combination of vegan and non-vegan food. If you have special needs regarding food (e.g. allergies), please forward your request to tue@rustaarhus.dk.
