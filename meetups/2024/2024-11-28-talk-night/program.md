## Unlocking Performance: A Beginner's Guide to Python-Rust Integration with PyO3

By [Thomas Fisker Christensen][tfc]

A beginner-level talk focusing on how to get started with [PyO3], which is a set of tools and libraries to seamlessly integrate Rust code in Python applications. The talk will focus on code examples and live-demos and is backed by practical experiences improving performance in a prototype system.

Thomas is a lead software engineer, driving the introduction of Rust at Lind Capital. His 20-year professional career has taken him from embedded C++ in PalmPilot and Motorola mobile phones, to C# development on the Microsoft .NET stack crossing domains as employment service, agriculture, classified ads, and energy trading.


## From Furnace to Firmware: A Hobbyist Embedded Rust Adventure with ESP32

By [Thomas Fisker Christensen][tfc]

Thomas will share the experience of building a pool temperature monitoring system as a hobby project, for his friends' portable furnace.

Technologies used: ESP32, no-STD [Embassy], [axum], [sqlx], [PostgreSQL] and [Grafana].

The talk will cover:

- The experiences of returning to embedded software after 15 years
- On site debugging with a laptop in one hand and an umbrella in the other
- A working live demo
