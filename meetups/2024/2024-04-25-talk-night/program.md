## Home automation with Rust
By [Cosmin Constantin Lazar][ccl]

In this beginner-level talk, Cosmin will share his journey learning Rust through a hands-on project: building an integration for [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant). This integration scrapes the [Kredsløb](https://www.kredslob.dk/produkter-og-services/genbrug-og-affald/affaldsbeholdere/toemmekalender) website to fetch garbage collection schedules for a specified address and then integrates these schedules into [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant). The talk will delve into the [source code](https://github.com/CosminLazar/ha-mitaffald) of the project, discuss the Rust crates utilized, and explore the software development lifecycle (SDLC) processes followed to bring this integration to life. This session is designed to offer practical insights into Rust development, making it a perfect opportunity for beginners eager to see how Rust projects are developed from concept to completion.

For the past 16 years, Cosmin has been building professional software solutions using the Microsoft .NET stack, tackling various industries like automotive, healthcare, classifieds, and commodity trading. He has served in roles ranging from a core contributor to leading teams, with positions including software developer, solution architect, and cloud solution architect. As a father of two, his limited free time is now spent on small home automation projects.
