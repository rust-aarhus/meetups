## SecGPT: using LLMs for secure Rust code

By [Benjamin Salling Hvass][bsh], [Mikkel Wienberg Madsen][mwm], [Gert Læssøe Mikkelsen][glm], [Bas Spitters][bs].

In the last couple of years, LLM based tools, like GitHub Copilot, have become a popular aide in software development.
They have been used for autocompletion, for translations and in reasoning. However, they have a tendency to hallucinate and to produce insecure code.
How well do they fare on rust, and can we use them to help us write safer and less vulnerable code?

Rust is a new and somewhat smaller language, which is less represented in the training data. So, one can expect some challenges.
At the same time, one can hope that rust's type checker and borrow checker can help to catch LLMs hallucinations.

In this talk we will go over several ways we have tried to use LLMs
in a more automated approach, from translation of other languages into rust, to fixing compiler errors and reasoning about software vulnerabilities.
The talk is also an invitation to collect feedback and experiences in the use of LLMs from the Rust Aarhus community.

[ The talk presents some of the outcomes of an explorative project supported by the CenSec cluster. ]
