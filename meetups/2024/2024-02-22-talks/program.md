An introduction to [WASI] (server-side WebAssembly), and the [WebAssembly component model][wasmcm], and how you can use [Spin] to easily get started. Spin is written in Rust, and has great support for writing server apps using Rust, as well as composing polyglot applications.

Mikkel, works at Fermyon, where he leads the product and developer relationships team. He has built cloud product for the last 10 years, most of the time at Microsoft. For the last year and a half, WebAssembly and Rust has been the thing he is mainly engaged in. Fermyon have created an open source project called Spin, a serverless framework, built in Rust, and using WebAssembly.
