# Venue Requirements

The following lists the requirements for the venue. Please let us know if there is one or more point that you cannot fulfill. Maybe we can find a solution.

This document is for two different types of meetups:
 1. *Rust and Talk*: This is a meetup with talks about different things related to Rust - one speaker at a time plus an audience.
 2. *Hack and Learn*: This is a more practical oriented meetup, where the members gathers in smaller groups to learn/hack on different topics.

 ## Rust and Talk
 - Space: We need space for at least 40 seated people.

## Hack and Learn
 - Space: We need space for at least 30 seated people and with an appropriate distance between the clusters.
 - Work clusters: We will have different clusters where people can work together (table and chairs). They are grouped as below - the number in parenthis is a guess on the number of people.
   - Beginners group (15): These should be gathered in one big cluster in front of a screen.
   - Exercise group (5): One cluster for doing exercises.
   - Experienced group (10): This consists of multiple dynamic clusters. The size of the clusters can be different and change throughout the evening.

## Common for both types
 - Time: Usually the event starts at 19:00 and ends around 21:00.
 - Presentation equipment: Projector or big screen.
 - Network: Guest wifi.
 - Directions: If the venue can be hard to find, please write a description that we can put in the program. There will be people coming by car and public transport.
 - Food and beverage: It is up to the host to decide what to serve. It can be sandwiches, pizza, etc. Please notice that there might be vegans in the crowd. For drinks, sodas and beers will do.

Just before the food is served, the host can use up to 10 min to give a short presentation of the company.
