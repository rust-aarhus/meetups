# Rust Aarhus Meetups
Rust Aarhus is a user group for the programming language named Rust. The user group will arrange events that take place in the Aarhus area in Denmark.

## Arranging a meetup
To start planning a new meetuo, create a new issue using the template matching the event type. Most likely you are not able to fill out all the fields when creating the issue. Feel free to edit the issue to add updated.

## Preparing a talk
If you need information about preparing a talk, then you should look [here](talks.md). To propose a new talk, find an event where the `N-talks` tag is NOT set, and comment on the issue.
